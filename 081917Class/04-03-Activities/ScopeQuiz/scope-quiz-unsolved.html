    // Run this program. Then turn to the person next to you and answer the following questions:
    // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
    //myVar1 is "globally" declared with respect to functions a1 and b1. So any manipulation done on myVar1 before either alert is called, the alerts will display the most recently instance of the manipulation. This is why both alerts in situation 1 print 2. 
    // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)
    //function a2 declares a new local valueof myVar2, which has no connection/link to the "globally" declared myVar2. This is only available within function a2. It is not passed to b2, so b2 reads the global declaration of myVar2.

    // Situation 1
    // ------------------------------------------
    var myVar1 = 1;

    function a1() {
      myVar1 = 5 - 3;
      b1();
      alert("Q1 | a: " + myVar1);
    }

    function b1() {
      alert("Q1 | b: " + myVar1);
    }

    // Situation 2
    // ------------------------------------------
